The article then explores how modern frameworks like Next.js and Remix have addressed these challenges through server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). The author provides detailed examples of when to use each approach, including performance benchmarks and real-world case studies.

In the final section, the article looks ahead to emerging patterns like React Server Components and streaming SSR. The author discusses how these technologies promise to combine the best aspects of traditional server rendering with the rich interactivity of client-side applications, while minimizing the JavaScript bundle size sent to users.`,
